# TodoRestApi

## Purpose
This repository stores the server files for my personal todo application: Oreo Todo Tracker. The server code will maintain REST API endpoints to send data down to a Vue client-side application. Data will come from the Atlas MongoDB service.

## Tech
Below is prerequisite technology you want to be familiar with and have in your dev environment:

* .Net Core 3.1 SDK
* MongoDB

## Upcoming
Below are upcoming changes to this repository:

* Add a data connection to an Atlas MongoDB service to start persisting data
* Finish scaffolding Todo endpoint
* Implement user authentication with JWT

## Demo
A demo of the app is not live yet.
